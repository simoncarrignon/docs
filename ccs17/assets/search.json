If you are interested to submit an abstract to the satellite at CCS 2018 (Thessaloniki) please go to this page. Proceedings | Call for Paper is open please see this page Scientific Background Human sociocultural evolution has been documented throughout the history of humans and earlier hominins. This evolution manifests itself through development from tools as simple as a rock used to break nuts, to something as complex as a spaceship able to land man on other planets. Equally, we have witnessed evolution of human population towards complex multilevel social organisation. Although cases of decrease and loss of this type of complexity have been reported, in global terms it tends to increase with time. Despite its significance, the conditions and the factors driving this increase are still poorly understood and subject to debate. Different hypothesis trying to explain the rise of sociocultural complexity in human societies have been proposed (demographic factor, cognitive component, historical contingency…) but so far no consensus has been reached. Here we raise a number of questions:  Can we better define sociocultural complexity and confirm its general tendency to increase over the course of human history? What are the main factors enablingan increase of cultural complexity? Are there reliable way to measure the complexity in material culture and social organisationconstructs, that is? How can we quantify and compare the impact of different factors? What causes a loss of cultural complexity in a society? And how often these losses occurred in the past? Goals of the session In this satellite meeting we want to bring together a community of researchers coming from different scientific domains and interested in different aspect of the evolution of social and cultural complexity. From archaeologists, to linguists, social scientists, historians and artificial intelligence specialists - the topic of sociocultural complexity transgresses traditional discipline boundaries. We want to establish and promote a constructive dialogue incorporating different perspectives: theoretical as well as empirical approaches, research based on historical and archaeological sources, as well as actual evidences and contemporary theories. We are particularly interested in formal approaches which enable more constructive theory building and hypothesis testing. However, even establishing common vocabulary of terms and concepts and discussing the main methodological challenges in studying sociocultural complexity is an important step towards a more cohesive framework for the understanding of cultural evolution in general and for individual research case studies in particular. Our approach is informed by the convergence between simulation and formal methods in archaeological studies and recent developments in complex systems science and complex network analysis. The session will focus but is not limited to: Social dynamics of innovation. Cumulative Culture and social learning. Evolution of Technology and technological changes Cognitive Process,Creativity, cooperation and innovation Population Dynamics and Demographic Studies Computer tools to understand the cultural evolutionary change ",

    "content": "CALL FOR PAPERS – Adaptive Behavior Special issue: “Evolution of Cultural Complexity” (Download the pdf of this CfP here) From a global perspective the sociocultural evolution of humans has been a strong driving force throughout our shared history. From the invention of tools as simple as a knapped pebble to the development of complex machines able to land men on the Moon, humans as a species have been developing, advancing and perfecting objects and techniques we use in our daily lives. Equally, we have witnessed a slow but steady shift among human groups towards more complex multilevel social organisations. Although never a case of continuous progress but rather an ebb and flow peppered with sudden surges in pace and dramatic collapses, the global trend can be characterised as an increase in cultural and social complexity over time. Despite its significance, the mechanisms and the factors driving this process are still poorly understood and subject to debate. What drives society to continuously update and elaborate their products? Why certain forms of social organisation seem to be more stable than others? What factors cause a sudden loss in cultural complexity? Different hypotheses trying to explain the rise of sociocultural complexity across human societies have been proposed, from demographic factor, cognitive component to historical contingency, but we are far from reaching a consensus. This special issue follows on from the session “Evolution of Cultural Complexity” held at the Conference on Complex System (2017 &amp; 2018), where those questions were discussed. However we also welcome submissions from authors who did not present. The submission can be of any of the types: original research article, review of the literature on the topic of the session, short communication and opinion (cf. the submission guideline of Adaptive Behavior for more information on these formats: https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/journal/adaptive-behavior#submission-guidelines). We invite studies related to the evolution of cultural complexity, including but not limited to the following topics:  Definition, proxies and quantification of cultural complexity Cultural transmission, cumulative culture and social learning Evolution of technology and technological change Social dynamics of innovation and cooperation Cognitive basis of creativity, cooperation and innovation Interactions between cultural complexity and population dynamics Methods and tools to study cultural complexity and evolutionary change The submission will proceed through the SAGE journal submission system: https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/ad-behav During the submission process please select the article type: “Special issue on the evolution of cultural complexity”. Please also note that submissions have to follow SAGE submission guidelines: https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/manuscript-submission-guidelines A Word template is available here and a Latex template here.

He is also a member of the Center for the Sciences of Complexity (C3) and coordinator of the 4E Cognition Group. He is interested in the dynamics of ritual practice, especially in the role of extreme rituals in the emergence of cognitive modernity (e.g. Froese et al. 2013; Woodward et al. 2015) and in the role of community ritual as a driver of early sociocultural complexity (e.g. Froese et al. 2014).      Froese, T., Woodward, A., &amp; Ikegami, T.
