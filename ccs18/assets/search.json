    "content": "Scientific Background Human sociocultural evolution has been documented throughout the history of humans and earlier hominins. This evolution manifests itself through development from tools as simple as a rock used to break nuts, to something as complex as a spaceship able to land man on other planets. Equally, we have witnessed evolution of human population towards complex multilevel social organisation. Although cases of decrease and loss of this type of complexity have been reported, in global terms it tends to increase with time. Despite its significance, the conditions and the factors driving this increase are still poorly understood and subject to debate. Different hypothesis trying to explain the rise of sociocultural complexity in human societies have been proposed (demographic factor, cognitive component, historical contingency…) but so far no consensus has been reached. Here we raise a number of questions:  Can we better define sociocultural complexity and confirm its general tendency to increase over the course of human history? What are the main factors enablingan increase of cultural complexity? Are there reliable way to measure the complexity in material culture and social organisationconstructs, that is? How can we quantify and compare the impact of different factors? What causes a loss of cultural complexity in a society? And how often these losses occurred in the past? Goals of the session In this satellite meeting we want to bring together a community of researchers coming from different scientific domains and interested in different aspect of the evolution of social and cultural complexity. From archaeologists, to linguists, social scientists, historians and artificial intelligence specialists - the topic of sociocultural complexity transgresses traditional discipline boundaries. We want to establish and promote a constructive dialogue incorporating different perspectives: theoretical as well as empirical approaches, research based on historical and archaeological sources, as well as actual evidences and contemporary theories. We are particularly interested in formal approaches which enable more constructive theory building and hypothesis testing. However, even establishing common vocabulary of terms and concepts and discussing the main methodological challenges in studying sociocultural complexity is an important step towards a more cohesive framework for the understanding of cultural evolution in general and for individual research case studies in particular. Our approach is informed by the convergence between simulation and formal methods in archaeological studies and recent developments in complex systems science and complex network analysis. The session will focus but is not limited to: Social dynamics of innovation. Cumulative Culture and social learning. Evolution of Technology and technological changes Cognitive Process,Creativity, cooperation and innovation Population Dynamics and Demographic Studies Computer tools to understand the cultural evolutionary change ",

    "content": "CALL FOR PAPERS – Adaptive Behavior Special issue: “Evolution of Cultural Complexity III” Download the pdf of the CfP here From a global perspective the sociocultural evolution of humans has been a strong driving force throughout our shared history. From the invention of tools as simple as a knapped pebble to the development of complex machines able to land men on the Moon, humans as a species have been developing, advancing and perfecting objects and techniques we use in our daily lives. Equally, we have witnessed a slow but steady shift among human groups towards more complex multilevel social organisations. Although never a case of continuous progress but rather an ebb and flow peppered with sudden surges in pace and dramatic collapses, the global trend can be characterised as an increase in cultural and social complexity over time. Despite its significance, the mechanisms and the factors driving this process are still poorly understood and subject to debate. What drives society to continuously update and elaborate their products? Why certain forms of social organisation seem to be more stable than others? What factors cause a sudden loss in cultural complexity? Different hypotheses trying to explain the rise of sociocultural complexity across human societies have been proposed, from demographic factor, cognitive component to historical contingency, but we are far from reaching a consensus. This special issue follows on from the session “Evolution of Cultural Complexity” held at the Conference on Complex System 2018, where those questions were discussed. However we also welcome submissions from authors who did not present.

Fine-grained individual-level data, detailing who learns from whom, would be most suited to answer this question empirically but this kind of data is difficult to obtain especially in pre-modern contexts. Therefore inference procedures have often been based on population-level data in form of frequency distributions of a number of different variants of a cultural trait at a certain point in time or of time-series that describe the dynamics of the frequency change of cultural variants over time, often comprising sparse samples from the whole population. In this talk we demonstrate that there exist theoretical limits to the accuracy of the inference of underlying processes of cultural transmission from aggregated data highlighting the problem of equifinality especially in situations of sparse data. Crucially we show the importance of rare variants for inferential questions. The presence, or absence, of rare variants as well as the spread behaviour of innovations carry a stronger signature about underlying processes than the dynamic of high-frequency variants. On the example of the choice of baby names, we illustrate that the consistency between empirical data, summarized by the so-called progeny, and hypotheses about cultural evolution such as neutral evolution or novelty biases depends entirely on the completeness of the data set considered. Analyses based on only the most popular variants, as is often the case in studies of cultural evolution, can provide misleading evidence for underlying processes of cultural transmission. 16h05 - 16h30: Coffee Break 16h30 - 16h55: Iza Romanowska, Simon Carrignon and Tom Brughmans.

    "content": "Peter Turchin (Complexity Science Hub–Vienna and University of Connecticut) {% include figure.html image=”/assets/turchin.jpg” alt=”Peter Turchin, UCONN” %} Peter Turchin is a scientist and an author who wants to understand how human societies evolve, and why we see such a staggering degree of inequality in economic performance and effectiveness of governance among nations (see Research Interests). Peter’s approach to answering these questions blends theory building with the analysis of data. He is the founder of a new transdisciplinary field of Cliodynamics, which uses the tools of complexity science and cultural evolution to study the dynamics of historical empires and modern nation-states. Peter has published two hundred articles, including a dozen in such top journals as Nature, Science, and PNAS (see Academic Publications). His publications are frequently cited and in 2004 he was designated as “Highly Cited Researcher” by ISIHighlyCited.com. Turchin has authored seven books (see his website), including Secular Cycles (with Sergey Nefedov, Princeton, 2009), and War and Peace and War (Penguin, 2005). webpage: peterturchin.com Anne Kandler (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology) {% include figure.html image=”https://www.eva.mpg.de/fileadmin/content_files/staff/anne_kandler/images/anne_kandler.jpg” alt=”Peter Turchin, UCONN” %} Anne Kandler is an applied mathematician interested in the underlying principles of cultural change especially in changing environmental conditions. Cultural change is often expressed by frequency changes of cultural traits, i.e. behaviour learnt socially, within and across populations. Social learning, however, can occur in a large variety of ways and my research aims at establishing why certain learning mechanisms evolved and in which situations they are expected to be present. In particular she is interested in bridging theoretical and empirical work in cultural evolution and focus on understanding the limits of inferability of underlying evolutionary processes from population-level data. She explores the question of how much information about social learning mechanisms is contained in observed frequency distributions describing a specific episode of cultural change. To do so she develops simulation and statistical inference methods to create frameworks for analysing cultural change accounting for the problem of equifinality. webpage: eva.mpg.de Abstract: Understanding how social information is used in human populations is one of the challenges in cultural evolution.
